In order to implement comments in this website I used `Disqus`

First I opened an account at [Disqus.com][disqus]{:target="_blank"} and then I followed the instructions offered by them on how
to add comments to my site. Eventually in one of the steps they give you a snippet of code to paste where you want the comments to appear.

Later on, once the Disqus box was displaying correctly, I modified the CSS so it will fit with the design used on the website.
