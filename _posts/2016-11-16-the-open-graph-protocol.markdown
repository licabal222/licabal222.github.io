`Open Graph` is a technology that helps websites turn into rich graph objects so that they integrate correctly with
 social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. Open Graph tells the social media site which information to show when sharing
 the webpage/site, consequently avoiding the display of advertising or irrelevant information.

To implement Open Graph in this assignment I added meta tags in the head-include of the website.
One for `og:title, og:type, og:url and og:image`

After the website is public you test out the displayed information by sharing the website in a social media site.
