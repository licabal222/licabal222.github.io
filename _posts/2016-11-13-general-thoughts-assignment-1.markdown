I have worked quite a bit with HTML/CSS before and my body pretty much runs on autopilot when creating a basic
website using traditional techniques; adding all these new variables into the equation of this project
did throw me off the wagon... hard! What would have taken me 30 minutes with the old approach, took me on this assignment
three times as much. `It was not love at first sight`.

But in the digital world you either evolve or you get left behind, so I know it is important to have an open mind and to don't give up.
Eventually I got a better hang of all of it and things started to work faster, smoother and even better than with a more traditional approach.

I can absolutely see the reason why people use these techniques and how much more easier would be to keep websites updated.
For me, I guess the problem was more stubbornness and accepting the different paths to thing I though I already knew.
Which is not bad at all, is all about getting more tools in the toolbox.
