* Full name: Lina Maria Cabal Romero.
* Cabal (Dad's last name), Romero (Mom's last name).
* It takes a lot for me to tan. I mostly burn. Many have been baffled by this latino mystery.
* Cities I have lived in: Bogota, Washington D.C., Orlando, Boston, Linköping, Umeå.
* I don't usually drink coffee, to the dismay of my colombian (and Swedish) family.
* I have a cat that is more social than many dogs I have met and wiggles her tale when happy.
* You could say I'm an introvert. Not a common thing among Colombians.
* Roller Derby is a newly discovered interest <3
