I was born and raised in Colombia’s capital city, Bogota. A massive, hectic and cosmopolitan place, filled with contrasts and mixed cultures.

As a member of a big extended family, growing up there was loud, sometimes rocky but all and all, a lot of fun. 
It didn't really follow conventional Swedish standards but it was a very nice time of my life indeed.

Still I also had this constant desire to see the world beyond my Colombian bubble. How would life look like somewhere 
else? ... And that was one of the reasons why after a few weeks of turning nineteen I moved to the US.

There I studied digital design, did jobs as a freelancer and later on worked at a company. The amount of lessons learned 
was immense but the most valuable thing was the opportunity to get to know people from all over the world. 
And funnny enough one of them became my "sambo".

A few years later my sambo and I decided to start fresh and consequently
we moved to Sweden, his home country. Our new life in the three crowns country started in January 2014.

The language was a must for me and I focused most of my attention to that the first years. 
However I have now move on to another chapter, as I have started studying the UDM program at Linnaeus University. 
Online though, as we are currently based in Umeå.
