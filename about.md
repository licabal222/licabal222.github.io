I was born and raised in Colombia’s capital city, Bogota. A massive, hectic and cosmopolitan place, filled with contrasts and mixed cultures.

As a member of a big extended family, growing up there was loud, sometimes rocky but all and all, a lot of fun. 
It didn't really follow conventional Swedish standards but it was a very nice time of my life indeed.

Still I also had this constant desire to see the world beyond my Colombian bubble. How would life look like somewhere 
else? ... And that was one of the reasons why after a few weeks of turning nineteen I moved to the US.

There I studied digital design, did jobs as a freelancer and later on worked at a company. The amount of lessons learned 
was immense but the most valuable thing was the opportunity to get to know people from all over the world.

A few years later my partner and I decided to start fresh and consequently
move to Sweden, his home country. Our new life in the three crowns country started in January 2014.

The language was a must for me and I focused most of my attention to that the first years. 
However I have now move on to another chapter, as I have started studying the UDM program at Linnaeus University. 
Online though, as we are currently based in Umeå.
